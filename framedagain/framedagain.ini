# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = The Framed Again mod's purpose is to make sure the PC is aware of the details of them being framed when they may have skipped the murder scene in SoD via features available in the Transitions mod when loaded with EET, though it doesn't require Transitions nor EET.  It will expand upon this in the future to include random attacks by bounty hunters sent from Duke Entar and allow for resolution and the end of attacks as well as provide for a lead-in to another motivation for going to Spellhold.
