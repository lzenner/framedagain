GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod requires BG2EE or EET.

The Framed Again mod's main purpose is to make sure the PC is aware of the details of them being framed when they may have skipped the murder scene in SoD via features available in the Transitions mod when loaded with EET, though it doesn't require Transitions nor EET.  It expands upon this to include random attacks by bounty hunters, allows for a resolution and the end of attacks and provides for a lead-in to another motivation for going to Spellhold. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Component: Add wanted poster and dialogue to Chateau Irenicus
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adds a wanted poster and perhaps an arrest warrant to Irenicus' dungeon and conversations about them to make sure the PC is aware of the frame-up details.
NOTE: If "The Cost Of One Girl's Soul" mod is installed, the item that starts the quest will be moved to the Genie in the Plane of Air to allow the PC time to learn about the murder and the significance of the dagger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add soul dagger to Chateau Irenicus if Cost of One Girl's Soul isn't loaded
* Make sure there are consequences to returning to city of BG before name is cleared (for EET)
* Add bounty hunter attacks until name cleared in Baldur's Gate
* Add quest to hand in soul dagger and stop attacks from bounty hunters and clear name
* Add comments about wanted posters to heads of temples, order of radiant heart and shadow thieves as well as some SoD NPCs such as Dorn
* Provide a lead-in for additonal quest mod dealing with Entar's revenge upon Irenicus

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're going to install Transitions, do so before the Framed Again mod.

Installation using Project Infinity (https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/1145416/#Comment_1145416) will ensure this and other mods are installed in the correct order.

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a framedagain folder and a setup-framedagain.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-framedagain.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-framedagain.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "framedagain" folder, setup-framedagain, and setup-framedagain.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-framedagain.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your EET installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safest bet.
Run WeInstall framedagain in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in the forum thread: https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/???/.
