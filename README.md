This mod requires BG2EE or EET.

The Framed Again mod's main purpose is to make sure the PC is aware of the details of them being framed when they may have skipped the murder scene in SoD via features available in the Transitions mod when loaded with EET, though it doesn't require Transitions nor EET.  It expands upon this to include random attacks by bounty hunters, allows for a resolution and the end of attacks and provides for a lead-in to another motivation for going to Spellhold.
